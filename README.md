Why 60% of the Machine Learning Projects Are Never Implemented ? 

It is because many of the people just simply learn the Machine learning but never implement. May be they try to implement but project drop due to lacks of DevOps concept. For this MlOps come in place . Machine learning operations (MLOps) is the use of machine learning models by development/operations (DevOps) teams. MLOps seeks to add discipline to the development and deployment of machine learning models by defining processes to make ML development more reliable and productive.
